### SafeLane
SafeLane is a an app that promotes awareness between bikers and neighboring cars to prevent a major cause of death within the city of LA. % of motor vehicle deaths are pedestrians and bikers. Bikers make up only 1% of the traffic, but account for %% of all vehicular deaths. We propose an app that integrates with google maps and waze to significantly increase the ability of bikers to communicate their presence to drivers.
